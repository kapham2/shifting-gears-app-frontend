# Shifting Gears
Combining my love for coding, cycling, engineering, physics, and math, I created Shifting Gears, a web application that helps beginner cyclists learn how to use their bicycle gears efficiently. This app simulates a cyclist pedaling at a constant cadence along a path of variable elevation. The cyclist shifts up to a harder gear when the ground is flat or when going downhill and shifts down to an easier gear when going uphill. The goal is to reach the highest average velocity at the end of the ride.
